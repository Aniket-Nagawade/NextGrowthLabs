1. Write about any difficult problem that you solved. (According to us, difficult - is something which 90% of people would have only 10% probability in getting a similarly good solution). 

Ans. I have not specifically worked on a very difficult problem. But, in the current project(Twitter Sentiment Analysis) that I am working on I was able to deal with a lot of challenging tasks such as:
	1. Data cleaning and preprocessing : I used re to remove all the unnecessary strings, stop words, lemmatization
	2. Text vectorization: I tried with tf-idf vectors and tf-idf weighted w2v
	3. Fine tuning the hyperparameters with the use of GridSearchCV
	4. Building supervised learning solutions, ranging from Logistic regression, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees, 		Ensemble Models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to Deep Neural Networks. This includes applying RNNs, LSTMs/GRUs, bidirectional RNNs and 	LSTMs etc. to my projects



2. Formally, a vector space V' is a subspace of a vector space V if V' is a vector space and every element of V′ is also an element of V.
Note that ordered pairs of real numbers (a,b) a,b∈R form a vector space V. Which of the following is a subspace of V?
	The set of pairs (a, a + 1) for all real a
	The set of pairs (a, b) for all real a ≥ b
	The set of pairs (a, 2a) for all real a
	The set of pairs (a, b) for all non-negative real a,b

Ans. The set of pairs (a, b) for all real a ≥ b
