App link - https://chromeappreviews.herokuapp.com/
I have created a streamlit app which I deployed on Heroku.
Steps for deployment:
1. Building a streamlit app(Chrome_App_Review.py). 
2. I added the below files in the desired path which allows Heroku to install the necessary requirements and run the application 
	requirements.txt : text file containing the libraries needed
	Procfile : The Procfile is used to execute the setup.sh and then call streamlit run to run the application.
	setup.sh : In the setup.sh file, we will create a streamlit folder with a credentials.toml and a config.toml file.
3. Creating a git repository by using the command git init 
4. Create a Heroku Account
5. Installing the Heroku COmmand Line Interface
6. Login to Heroku
7. Deploy the Application using Heroku create
8. Push the code to that instance using the below commands:
	git add .
	git commit -m "initial commit"
	git push heroku master
